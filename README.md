# üöó Car Damage Detection using Deep Learning

A machine learning project focused on detecting and classifying car damage using deep learning models. This project compares two different architectures for car damage detection, utilizing a dataset of car images from Kaggle. The models were trained and evaluated using TensorFlow and Keras in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

Both models are assessed based on their accuracy, performance, and resource efficiency.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Model Architectures

### Model 1: **MobileNetV2**
- Pre-trained MobileNetV2 architecture
- Used transfer learning to fine-tune the model
- Key steps: Loading base model, attaching custom head, training on car damage dataset

### Model 2: **Custom CNN**
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built from scratch
- Key steps: Convolutional layers for feature extraction, dense layers for classification, with dropout regularization
- Architecture: Conv -> ReLU -> MaxPool -> Dropout -> Fully Connected -> Softmax

- **Preprocessing**: Images were preprocessed (resize, normalize, label encoding).
- **Data Augmentation**: Used `ImageDataGenerator` to perform augmentation (rotation, zoom, etc.).
- **Model Training**: Both models were trained and validated on the Kaggle dataset.
- **Results Visualization**: Accuracy and loss plots were generated for training and validation data.
  
## üìà Results and Performance Comparison

| Metric          | MobileNetV2 | 
|-----------------|-------------|
| Accuracy        | 78.7%       |
| Parameters      | 2,422,210   | 


- MobileNetV2 showed better **accuracy** with a faster **inference time** due to transfer learning.
- Custom CNN required more time to train but offered more flexibility in terms of tuning the architecture.
